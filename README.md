# DLoc code

This repository has the MATLAB data pre-processing and the PyTorch implementation of DLoc from [Deep Learning based Wireless Localization for Indoor Navigation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3372224.3380894). 

The datasets required to run these codes can be downloaded from the [WILD](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu/wild/) website.

## MATLAB Codes
These codes contain the pre-processing codes to convert the raw Channel-State-Information that is downloaded from the [WILD](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu/wild/) website to the 2D XY heatmap images shown in the paper.

For further details please refer to the [README](./MATLAB/README.md) file in the MATLAB folder.

## PyTorch Codes

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Training and Evlautaion

To train the model(s) in the paper and evaluate them, run this command:

```train
python train_and_test.py
```

The file automatically imports the parameters from [params.py](params.py).

The parameters and their descriptions can be found in the comments of the example implementaion of the [params.py](params.py) file.

To recreate the results from the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3372224.3380894) refer to the [README](./params_storage/README.md) of the *params_storage* folder.
